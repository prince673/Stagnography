# Steganography Project

This project demonstrates the use of steganography to hide data within audio files. Steganography is the practice of hiding secret data within other files or media. In this case, the `extract_data` function in the `steganography.py` file extracts the hidden data from an audio file using least significant bit (LSB) steganography.

## Background
Steganography has been used for a long time to conceal messages and carry out covert communication. It is a technique of hiding information in such a way that it is not only hidden from casual inspection but also from skilled analysts. The technique is often used by spies to send secret messages, and it is also used in cryptography to protect sensitive data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `wave` module

## Setup
1. Install the required libraries using the following command:
